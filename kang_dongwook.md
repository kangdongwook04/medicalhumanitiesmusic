# Still Alice

 [This film's music](https://youtu.be/dB-B8uo4Oco?si=msQVvvdjXxsJnDMd) delicately expresses the protagonist’s emotional decline through its music, as she gradually loses her memory to Alzheimer’s. The gentle piano melodies and the gradually intensifying strings mirror the progression of the disease and Alice’s emotional shifts, allowing the audience to empathize with her fear and confusion. Compared to Wozzeck, which uses dissonance and aggressive rhythms to depict psychological chaos, Still Alice takes a softer, more introspective musical approach to inner disorientation. The theme of human dignity is poignantly embodied in the scene where Alice gives a speech at a conference, struggling to hold onto her identity—an emotional moment further elevated by the music’s quiet strength.


Example: Similar disease is described in Alban Berg's 1925 film [*Wozzeck*](jang_geunyeong.md). The film contains the contents of Mental illness.
