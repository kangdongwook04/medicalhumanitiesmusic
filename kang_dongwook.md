# Still Alice
The music of the film delicately captures the inner world in which Alice gradually loses her memory and falls into confusion. The harmony of the soft piano melody and the gradually accumulating string instruments symbolizes the gradual progress of the disease and the ups and downs of the emotion. The music makes the audience sympathize with Alice's fear and loss, but emphasizes the human dignity that Alice tries to protect to the end.
